              On 3rd February, 2020, a notable alumni of NIT Durgapur, Dr.
              Nagahanumaiah, the director of Central Manufacturing Technology
              Institute, Bengaluru helped everyone with his speech on Industry
              4.0 and it’s opportunities and challenges. He described the
              technologies inherent in Industry 4.0 and the opportunities and
              challenges for research in this area. Industry 4.0 connotes a new
              industrial revolution centred around cyber-physical systems. It
              posits that the real-time connection of physical and digital
              systems, along with new enabling technologies, will change the way
              that work is done and therefore, how work should be managed. It
              has the potential to break, or at least change, the traditional
              operations trade-offs among the competitive priorities of cost,
              flexibility, speed, and quality. The focus is on goods-producing
              industries, which includes both the manufacturing and agricultural
              sectors. Specific technologies that were discussed included
              additive manufacturing, the internet of things, blockchain,
              advanced robotics, and artificial intelligence.

              beautiful speech on additive manufacturing and industry 4.0. his
              main objective in the seminar was to classify the current
              knowledge (and technological trends) on Additive Manufacturing and
              to highlight its potential uses. He presented a comprehensive
              review on Additive Manufacturing technologies together with both
              its contributions to Industry 4.0. The latest industrial
              revolution, Industry 4.0, is encouraging the integration of
              intelligent production systems and advanced information
              technologies. Additive manufacturing is considered to be an
              essential ingredient in this new movement. The seminar focused on
              three important aspects of Additive Manufacturing: recent advances
              on material science, process development, and enhancements on
              design consideration. The seminar was quite interesting which gave
              a new outlook to the students about the prospects of the industry.
