                <br />
                On behalf of Centre for Alumni Affairs &amp; International
                relations (CAAIR), NIT Durgapur, I wish you all a very
                happy,healthy and prosperous new year 2020!
                <br />
                As you know, the Centre for Alumni Affairs &amp; International
                Relations (CAAIR), established in the year 2018 under the
                guidance of our Honourable Director, is the coordinating centre
                of the Institute for liaison with REC/NIT Durgapur alumni all
                across the globe, initiating research/academic collaboration
                with universities and organizations in India and abroad and
                other outreach activities.
                <br />
                Currently, our interactions with alumni are taking place on
                multiple dimensions. The most important point for us is the
                absolute increase in alumni footfall on campus. There is no
                particular season now for alumni visits – they happen throughout
                the year. We are delighted that they are keen to spend a day in
                the campus, interact with students and faculty, and learn about
                the progress of the Institute and how they can chip in to help.
                <br />
                The “Eminent Alumni Lecture Series” is a runaway success, and we
                recently hosted the 15 th lecture. A Lecture in the name of
                “Professor Asoke Sen Memorial Lecture” has been instituted in
                honour of Prof. Asoke Kumar Sen, the Legendary and inspiring
                faculty of R.E.College Durgapur (Presently NIT Durgapur).
                <br />
                Being associated with this esteemed Institute as a student,
                alumnus, faculty, Associate Dean (Alumni &amp; Outreach) and
                presently as coordinator, CAAIR, has helped me to perceive the
                Institute through multi-dimensional aspects. As a result, the
                need to address dynamic requirements of the Institute and the
                strategies thereof has become immaculate.
                <br />
                You are a part of our timeline, and your engagement with the
                Institute is crucial in helping us to reach our mission and
                vision. We have taken this approach following major Technical
                Institutes in India and abroad to increase our sustainable
                fundraising and enhance our NIRF ranking.
                <br />
                I do envisage alumni playing a proactive role in successful
                implementation of the Institute diamond Jubilee year exercise
                including facilitating mentoring students &amp; faculty,
                industry and academia linkages and participating actively in the
                development and overall growth of our beloved Alma mater. The
                joy of giving back during Institute Diamond Jubilee year is
                another key step in this direction and I hope you will actively
                participate and contribute towards developing sustainable fund
                raising, building NIT Durgapur brand etc.
                <br />
                Therefore, be proud to be connected, and make other
                alumnus/Alumna proud by connecting and contributing generously
